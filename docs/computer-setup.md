> 1.  A tool for getting/updating projects
> 2.  An environment to run it in

[GitHub](https://github.com) is our tool for distributing projects and managing updates. We discuss GitHub in more detail in the next section ([managing projects with GitHub](#github-project-management.md)). For now you'll need to:

- [Create a free GitHub Account](https://github.com/join)
- [Download GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)

> 💡 GitHub Desktop isn't necessary if you'd prefer to work in [Terminal](terminal-basics.md) (but make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed)

For managing project environments, we use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com). We recommend the [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/) app for anyone not comfortable working in Terminal.

- [Anaconda Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) _(recommended for most)_
  - select the **64-Bit Graphical Installer** for your operating system. Note that some older Windows computer may need to install the **32-Bit Graphical Installer** (you can check [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/32-bit-and-64-bit-windows-frequently-asked-questions-c6ca9541-8dce-4d48-0415-94a3faa2e13d))

Once you have done all the above, you're ready to start downloading and running projects.

We've provided a 🧪 [Setup Test Project](https://github.com/saud-learning-services/setup-test) on our GitHub that you can use throughout the remainder of the documentation to ensure you have everything up and running correctly.

By the end you should see an output that looks something like (but printing your first name intead - as it appears on Canvas):

> 💡 Every reference to the test project in the remainder of the docs will be labeled using the 🧪 icon
