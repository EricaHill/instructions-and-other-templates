# instructions-and-other-templates
To maintain a single version of instructions or other templates.

## Contains
master_environment.yml - sauder_canvas_api environment so only need one environment
- will need to be (annoyingly) manually maintained
- **TODO** need to add workflow to make sure all projects work in master_environment

## Each Project Should Have
- README.md (use readme_template as template)
> - should be simple instructions associated with project

## All Projects Will
- be able to run in the master_environment - sauder_canvas_api
- have a single set of instructions for Sauder Ops team to follow (only difference will by which jupyter notebook is run) 
- be able to run using GitHub Desktop and Anaconda OR Command line

## Sauder Ops Instructions should
- reference sauder_canvas_api as the environment
- use generic reference to "Project Name", (project-name, PROJECT_NAME etc etc) where possible
-- for screenshots using examples, clearly indicate as example
- assume that Ops uses GitHub Desktop setup to locate files in Documents/GitHub/Sauder_Learning_Services

## Other
- keep a copy of unedited images for other uses
- use Snagit for editing images, try to keep consistent
